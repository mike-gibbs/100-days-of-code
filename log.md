**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
-
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: June 25th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completing basics to HTML & HTML 5.

**Thoughts** Completed basics to HTML & HTML 5. I've already completed these challenges in the past but I thought it good as a refresher. Created a Code Pen site to record my progress and build a site with my new skills as I learn. Right now I'm kind of slow moving as I warm my self up to coding on a daily basis. I think as time progresses I will spend more time coding, complete more challenges and build bigger projects. So glad I'm doing this.
